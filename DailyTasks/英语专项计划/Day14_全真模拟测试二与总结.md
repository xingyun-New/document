### 第三部分：阅读理解（共15题，每题2分）

**Passage 1: Social Media and Teenagers**

Social media has become a big part of teenagers' lives. Apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat are very popular. While social media can be fun and useful, it also has some negative effects on young people.

On the positive side, social media helps teenagers stay connected with friends and family. It's a great way to share photos, videos, and news. Social media can also be educational. Many teenagers use it to learn new skills, watch educational videos, or join groups about their interests.

However, social media also has downsides. First, it can be addictive. Many teenagers spend hours on social media every day, which affects their sleep, homework, and real-life relationships. Second, social media can affect mental health. Comparing yourself to others online can make you feel bad about yourself. Cyberbullying is also a serious problem.

Third, social media can spread false information. Not everything you see online is true. Teenagers need to learn to think critically about what they read and share.

So, how can teenagers use social media wisely? Set time limits. Don't check your phone first thing in the morning or right before bed. Remember that people usually only post their best moments, so don't compare your whole life to someone else's highlight reel. Be kind online and report bullying. And always check if information is true before sharing it.

**21.** What is the main topic of this passage?
   A. How to use social media apps  
   B. The effects of social media on teenagers  
   C. Why social media is bad  
   D. How to make friends online

**22.** Which is NOT mentioned as a positive effect of social media?
   A. Staying connected with others  
   B. Learning new skills  
   C. Getting better grades  
   D. Sharing photos and videos

**23.** According to the passage, how can social media affect mental health?
   A. By helping people relax  
   B. By making people compare themselves to others  
   C. By giving people more energy  
   D. By making people smarter

**24.** What does "highlight reel" mean in this passage?
   A. All the bad moments  
   B. The best moments  
   C. Daily routines  
   D. Future plans

**25.** Which advice is given for using social media wisely?
   A. Use it all the time

   C. Compare yourself to others  
   D. Believe everything online

**Passage 2: The Amazing Octopus**

The octopus is one of the most intelligent and fascinating creatures in the ocean. These eight-armed animals have some incredible abilities that make them unique.

First, octopuses are masters of disguise. They can change their color and texture in less than a second to match their surroundings. This helps them hide from predators and sneak up on prey. They do this using special cells in their skin called chromatophores.

Second, octopuses are very intelligent. They can solve problems, use tools, and even learn by watching other octopuses. In experiments, octopuses have opened jars to get food inside and navigated through mazes. They have been observed using coconut shells as protective shelters.

Third, octopuses have an amazing defense mechanism. When threatened, they can squirt a cloud of dark ink. This confuses predators and gives the octopus time to escape. The ink even contains a substance that dulls the predator's sense of smell.

Another interesting fact is that octopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Their blood is blue because it contains copper instead of iron.

Despite their intelligence and special abilities, octopuses have short lives. Most species only live for 1-2 years. After mating, male octopuses usually die within a few months, and females die after their eggs hatch.

The octopus teaches us that intelligence comes in many forms and can be found throughout the animal kingdom.

**26.** How many arms does an octopus have?
   A. Six  B. Seven  C. Eight  D. Ten

**27.** What are chromatophores?
   A. Special organs for breathing  
   B. Special cells for changing color  
   C. Special arms for catching prey  
   D. Special eyes for seeing in the dark

**28.** Which is NOT mentioned as an example of octopus intelligence?
   A. Solving problems  
   B. Using tools  
   C. Speaking to humans  
   D. Opening jars

**29.** Why is octopus blood blue?
   A. Because it contains iron  
   B. Because it contains copper  
   C. Because they live in the ocean  
   D. Because they are very cold

**30.** How long do most octopuses live?
   A. 1-2 months  B. 1-2 years  C. 5-10 years  D. 20-30 years

**Passage 3: The Benefits of Volunteering**

Volunteering means doing work without getting paid. People volunteer for many reasons, and it brings benefits to both the volunteers and the community.

For the community, volunteers provide important services. They help in schools, hospitals, animal shelters, and environmental projects. Without volunteers, many organizations couldn't operate. Volunteers make a real difference in people's lives.

For the volunteers themselves, there are many benefits. First, volunteering gives you a sense of purpose and satisfaction. Helping others makes you feel good about yourself. Second, it's a great way to meet new people and make friends. When you volunteer, you work with others who share your interests and values.

Third, volunteering can help you learn new skills. Whether you're teaching children, organizing events, or caring for animals, you develop skills that can help in your future career. Many employers value volunteer experience because it shows you're responsible and care about others.

Fourth, volunteering is good for your health. Research shows that people who volunteer are happier and less stressed. Helping others gives life meaning and can even help you live longer.

For students, volunteering has additional benefits. It looks good on college applications and resumes. It helps you explore career interests. And it makes you a more well-rounded person.

So how can you start volunteering? Think about what you're interested in and what skills you have. Look for volunteer opportunities in your community – schools, libraries, hospitals, parks, or animal shelters. Start with a few hours a week and see how it goes. You might discover a new passion!

**31.** What does "volunteering" mean?
   A. Doing paid work  
   B. Doing work without pay  
   C. Asking for help  
   D. Looking for a job

### 第四部分：综合填空（共10题，每题1分）

**Learning from Failure**

Failure is something everyone ___36___ (experience) in life. However, many people are afraid of ___37___ (fail). They think failure means they are not good enough. But this is wrong.

Actually, failure can be a great teacher. When we fail, we learn what doesn't work. This helps us find ___38___ (good) ways to succeed. Many ___39___ (success) people failed many times before they achieved their goals.

For example, Thomas Edison failed ___40___ (thousand) of times before he invented the light bulb. But he didn't give up. He said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." His positive attitude helped him ___41___ (succeed) finally.

J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter, was ___42___ (reject) by many publishers before her book was accepted. But she kept trying, and now she is one of the most ___43___ (fame) writers in the world.

So, don't be afraid of failure. Instead, see it as an opportunity to learn and grow. When you fail, ask ___44___ (you): "What can I learn from this?" Then try again with a different approach. Remember, failure is not the opposite of success – it's a ___45___ (step) stone to success.
