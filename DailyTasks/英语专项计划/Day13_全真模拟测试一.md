**Passage 1: Healthy Eating Habits**

Good eating habits are important for our health. Here are some tips to help you eat healthily.

First, eat breakfast every day. Breakfast is the most important meal. It gives you energy for the morning. Try to eat whole grains, fruits, and protein for breakfast.

Second, eat more fruits and vegetables. They contain vitamins and minerals that your body needs. Try to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Choose different colors to get different nutrients.

**Passage 2: The Power of Kindness**

When I was in Grade 7, I had a classmate named Sarah. She was new to our school and didn't have many friends. She was quiet and shy, and some students made fun of her because she wore old clothes and had an unusual accent.

One day, I saw Sarah sitting alone during lunch, looking sad. I decided to sit with her. At first, we didn't talk much, but gradually we became friends. I learned that Sarah's family had moved from another country and they were having financial difficulties. Despite these challenges, Sarah was very kind and had a great sense of humor.

I invited Sarah to join our group. Some of my friends weren't happy about it at first, but they soon realized how nice Sarah was. She helped me with math, and I helped her improve her English. We became best friends.

By the end of the year, Sarah had many friends and was much more confident. She told me that my kindness changed her life. She said if I hadn't talked to her that day, she might have given up and changed schools.

This experience taught me that small acts of kindness can make a big difference. We never know how much our actions might help someone who is struggling.

**26.** Why didn't Sarah have many friends at first?

**Passage 3: Electric Cars**

Electric cars are becoming more popular around the world. Unlike traditional cars that run on gasoline, electric cars use batteries and electric motors. This makes them better for the environment and cheaper to operate.

One of the main advantages of electric cars is that they produce zero emissions. This means they don't release harmful gases into the air like gasoline cars do. This is important for fighting air pollution and climate change.

Electric cars are also cheaper to run. Electricity costs less than gasoline, and electric cars require less maintenance. They don't need oil changes, and their brakes last longer because of regenerative braking, which captures energy when you slow down.

However, electric cars also have some disadvantages. The main problem is their limited range. Most electric cars can only travel 200-300 kilometers on a single charge. This is less than gasoline cars. Also, charging takes much longer than filling up with gas. It can take several hours to fully charge an electric car.

Another issue is the lack of charging stations. While there are gas stations everywhere, charging stations for electric cars are still not common in many areas. This "range anxiety" makes some people hesitant to buy electric cars.

Despite these challenges, electric car technology is improving rapidly. Batteries are getting better, allowing cars to travel farther. More charging stations are being built. Many countries are planning to ban gasoline cars in the future. It seems clear that electric cars will play an important role in transportation in the coming years.

**31.** What do electric cars use instead of gasoline?
   A. Oil  B. Batteries  C. Water  D. Coal

**32.** Which is NOT an advantage of electric cars mentioned in the passage?
   A. Zero emissions  
   B. Cheaper to run  
   C. Faster than gasoline cars  
   D. Less maintenance needed

**33.** How far can most electric cars travel on a single charge?
   A. 100-200 km  B. 200-300 km  C. 300-400 km  D. 500-600 km

**34.** What does "range anxiety" mean in this passage?
   A. Fear of going too fast  
   B. Worry about running out of power  
   C. Excitement about new technology  
   D. Concern about the price

**35.** What is the writer's opinion about the future of electric cars?
   A. They will completely replace gasoline cars soon  
   B. They will play an important role in transportation  
   C. They will never become popular  
   D. They are too expensive for most people
