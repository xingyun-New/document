Dear Tom,

I'm worried about you because I heard that you spend too much time 
playing mobile games. This is very bad for you.

First, it affects your study. You don't have time to do homework. 
Second, playing games for too long is bad for your eyes. Third, it 
affects your sleep, and you will feel tired the next day.

I think you should set a time limit for games. Why don't you do more 
sports or develop other hobbies? Reading books or playing basketball 
can also be interesting.

I hope you can take my advice. I care about you.

Yours,
Li Hua
