**Screen Time and Health**

Do you spend a lot of time looking at screens? Many teenagers today use smartphones, tablets, and computers for several hours every day. While technology brings us many benefits, too much screen time can be harmful to our health.

First, spending too much time on screens is bad for our eyes. Staring at screens for a long time can cause eye strain, dryness, and headaches. Doctors recommend the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

Second, screen time before bedtime can affect our sleep. The blue light from screens tricks our brain into thinking it's still daytime. This makes it harder to fall asleep. Experts suggest not using screens at least one hour before going to bed.

Third, too much screen time means less physical activity. When we're glued to our screens, we're not moving our bodies. This can lead to health problems like obesity and weak muscles.

However, screens are not all bad. They help us learn, communicate with friends and family, and enjoy entertainment. The key is to use them wisely. Set time limits, take regular breaks, and balance screen time with other activities like reading books, playing sports, or spending time outdoors.

**21.** What is the main idea of this passage?
A. Screens are very helpful

D. Teenagers love using screens

**22.** According to the passage, what can too much screen time cause?

**The Future of Food: Insects?**

What will we eat in the future? Scientists say that insects might become an important part of our diet. While eating insects might sound strange to many people, about 2 billion people around the world already eat them regularly.

Why insects? First, insects are very nutritious. They contain a lot of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Some insects have even more protein than beef or chicken. Second, raising insects is much better for the environment than raising animals like cows or pigs. Insects need less food, water, and space. They also produce fewer greenhouse gases.

There are more than 1,900 types of edible insects. Some of the most popular are crickets, grasshoppers, and mealworms. In Thailand, you can buy fried insects at street markets. In Mexico, people eat tacos filled with grasshoppers. Some restaurants in Europe and North America are starting to serve insect dishes.

Of course, many people still feel uncomfortable about eating insects. Food companies are trying to make insect products more acceptable. For example, they grind insects into powder and use it to make protein bars, pasta, and bread. This way, people can get the benefits of insect protein without actually seeing the insects.

Will insects replace traditional meat? Probably not completely. But they could become an important alternative, especially as the world's population continues to grow and we need to find more sustainable ways to feed everyone.

**31.** What is the main topic of this passage?
A. Insects are dangerous

C. How to cook insects  
D. Why people hate insects
