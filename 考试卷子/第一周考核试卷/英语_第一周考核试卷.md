### Passage B

Dear Tom,

I'm glad to hear that you will come to China next month. I'm writing to tell you something about Chinese school rules.

First, students should come to school on time. If you are late, you should explain the reason to your teacher. Second, students should wear school uniforms on school days. Third, students are not allowed to use mobile phones in class. You can use your phone during break time, but you should turn it off during class.

Also, you should respect your teachers and be friendly to your classmates. In China, we usually stand up when the teacher comes into the classroom. We also greet the teacher by saying "Good morning, teacher!" or "Good afternoon, teacher!"

Besides, you should keep the classroom clean and tidy. Don't eat food with strange smells in the classroom. And don't run in the corridors because it may be dangerous.

I hope you will have a good time in China. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.

Yours,
Li Ming

**How to Protect the Environment**

The environment is very important for our life. However, it is being destroyed seriously. We should take action to protect it.
