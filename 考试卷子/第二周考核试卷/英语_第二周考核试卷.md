## Part Four: Reading Comprehension（阅读理解，每题2分，共20分）

### Passage A

Dear Principal,

I am writing to give you some suggestions about our school rules.

First, I think we should be allowed to use mobile phones during lunch break. Many students need to contact their parents, and a short phone call won't affect our study.

Second, I suggest that we can wear our own clothes on Fridays. The school uniform is comfortable, but wearing our own clothes once a week will make us happier.

Finally, I hope the library can stay open until 7 pm. If we have more time to use the library, we can read more books and improve our knowledge.

I believe these changes will benefit all students. I hope you will consider my suggestions.

Yours sincerely,
Li Ming

**参考范文：**

Dear Wang Ming,

I'm worried about you because I heard you spend too much time playing online games recently.

Playing games too much is harmful. First, it affects your study. Your grades have dropped a lot. Second, it's bad for your health. You don't exercise and your eyesight is getting worse.

Here is my advice. You should reduce your game time and spend more time on your study. Besides, you'd better do more exercise, such as running or playing basketball. If you have any problems, you can talk to your parents or teachers.

I hope you can take my advice and become better soon.

Yours,
Li Hua
